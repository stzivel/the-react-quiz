# The React Quiz

This React-based quiz application is designed to test users' knowledge of React with a collection of 15 questions. The quiz offers an engaging experience by incorporating a timer to add a sense of urgency to each question. Users earn points for correct answers and are informed about their progress throughout the quiz. Furthermore, at the end of the quiz, the application provides users with a high score, motivating them to compete and improve their React knowledge.

To manage the application's state efficiently, the code utilizes the Context API. This allows for seamless data sharing between components and ensures a smooth user experience. The quiz questions and options are fetched from a fake API using JSON Server, which simulates a real data source.

Users are guided through different screens, such as a loading screen while questions are fetched, an error screen in case of data retrieval issues, a start screen to kick off the quiz, and question screens during the quiz.
